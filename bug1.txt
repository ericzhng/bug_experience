Some common bugs

1. MATLAB for loop and C++ for loop are different.

for k=1:N
  ...
  if error < 0
    break;
  end
end

after iteration ends, k = N. if the iteration breaks at some point, k = k1.

for (int k = 0; k < N, k++){
  ... 
  if error < 0
    break;
}

after the iteration ends, k = N. if the iteration breaks at some point, k = k1 - 1.
