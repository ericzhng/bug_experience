sometimes when using preferencefragment, your settings activity won't be able to launch, one possible reason is that preferenceTheme is not set.

	<item name="preferenceTheme">@style/PreferenceThemeOverlay</item>
		
This would cause errors such as:
	android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file: Error inflating class fragment
